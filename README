WXJM Mobile

This is an iOS project for WXJM, the student run radio station of James Madison University.
WXJM has a link on their website to allow for streaming online, but why not make it more accessible
for those of us who want accessibility at the forefront, iOS users.

Enter WXJM mobile, a one tab instant streaming application produced for WXJM by me, Kevin L. Hopkins
for their usage and distribution through the app store.

As long as they keep the hard work rolling over the air, I'll make sure they're covered on the mobile front.

@todo:
Write code for Android as well.
